      <p>From time immemorial, thousands have flocked to the mountainous terrain of Almidrangh for various reasons: to sample the unique cuisine, to do business in its jam-packed financial districts, or for other causes. However, nowadays, most visitors are attracted to the far-west land for purposes of tourism: that is, they desire to view the nation’s mysterious living clouds. Also called zhenitankh, meaning “mist-boned ones” in the country’s native language, it is still a mystery how, and arguably more importantly WHY, these strange creatures are born in, suddenly vacate, and inevitably turn to this strange and wondrous land.</p>
      <p>However, due to recent strides in the infant field of nephobiology (which is to say, the study of zhenitankh), scientists as well as the general public know more about these titanic oddities than ever before. Their types have been codified, classified and categorized based on shared characteristics, giving rise to the even newer field of nephotaxonomy (which is to say, the organization of cloud ‘species’).</p>
      <p>In addition to information on cloud species, we here at Grenin Arcanobiology Guild have provided a guide to safe cloudwatching, in addition to <a href="secret-subpage.html">[WARNING. DATA CORRUPTED.]</a> Please, don’t hesitaste to immerse yourself in our field-verified, professionally-edited, nephobiology-centered topics. And remember, <span title="Have fun. Be safe">tangkho alogont, sur tangkho canitonkh!</span></p>
