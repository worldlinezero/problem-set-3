      <p>When observing clouds in the field, it is always important to know what to do about clouds' behaviors relative to you. Below is a helpful (but by NO means conclusive) guide on deimatic (threat display) behavior in clouds:
<hr/>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Cloud species</th>
              <th>Threat display appearance</th>
              <th>Explanation and Suggested actions</th>
              <th>Danger level</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Cumuloanimus</td>
            <td>Zhenitankh comes close to the ground, appears grayer than usual and starts hailing and/or snowing</td>
            <td>Get an umbrella or vacate the area. The cloud wants you to leave. Continued presence will cause blizzards.</td>
            <td>Green to Light Green - Safe to Moderately safe</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Strataloanimus</td>
            <td>Zhenitankh comes seems to 'coil up,' possibly resulting in high winds. Additionally, drizzle or rain is possible.</td>
            <td>The cloud likely sees you as a threat to itself or as a competitor to a possible mate. Leave the area. High winds and rain have known to escalate to twisters and near-monsoon conditions.</td>
            <td>Light green to orange - Moderately safe to danger escalating</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cirroanimus</td>
            <td>Clouds are spreading out/separating from the main cloud body.</td>
            <td>Zhenitankh is segmenting itself as a defense mechanism and its former body parts are dropping to the earth. Spiny plates WILL impact with the ground. Notify the relevant law enforcement/military/paramilitary entity, as this could set off a chain reaction with other cirroanimus specimens, similar to a stampede. Evacuate the area.</td>
            <td>Yellow to dark orange - Fairly unsafe to especially dangerous</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Nimbuloanimus</td>
            <td>Specimen's vapour walls appear larger. Appearance of dangerous weather conditions such as tornadoes or tropical storms. Other specimens congregate with one in question.</td>
            <td>WARNING! The nimbuloanimi are hunting you or a group of people they consider you associated with. Exercise extreme caution. Notify relevant law enforcement/militar/paramilitary entity. Evacuate the region. Stay inside as long as possible. Nimbuloanimus specimens have been known to hunt for weeks. They will form multiple (MULTIPLE!) hurricane cells to hunt. Good luck, and godspeed.</td>
            <td>Dark red - maximum/LETHAL danger.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
          <tr>
            <td>Note: always consult an expert when dealing with specimens in the field. They most likely know more than you do. Possibly even more than this guide provides.</td>
          </tr>
        </tfoot>
      </table>
