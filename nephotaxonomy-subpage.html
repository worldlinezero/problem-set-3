      <h1>Nephotaxonomy: Cloud Genera and Taxonomical Classification</h1>
        <h4>An exercise in worldbuilding</h4>
          <h5>Originally conceived by Aidan Bennett</h5>
      <p>Most species of zhenitankh are almost identical to their nonliving counterparts. Both are mainly composed of fine water vapour particles. However, obviously, living clouds come with the inclusion of several internal organs and body parts which perform various functions based on the species of cloud they are located in. For instance, a hand that grasps other clouds in a predatory could be a sort of membranous locomotion appendage in an algaevorous specimen. However, most clouds have at least the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A set of 6-45 bones arranged in a traditional spinal column, much like in dogs or other tetrapodal organisms.</li>

        <li>Some sort of locomotive bone structure or membrane, so that the zhenitankh can guide itself in the mind-boggling speed of the jetstreams.</li>
        <li>Organs at least somewhat analogous to those in humans, such as lungs (much larger due to lack of oxygen in their environment), a heart, and a brain.</li>

        <li>Sensory organs such as eyes and ears, or a structure that acts like a plate conducive to ultrasonic echolocation.</li>

      <hr/>
      <p>There are four main genuses in zhenitankh: cumuloanimus, strataloanimus, cirroanimus, and nimbuloanimus.</p>
        <img src="../problem-set-3/images/cumuloanimus.jpg" alt="A cumuloanimus specimen." title="A cumuloanimus specimen."/><img src="../problem-set-3/images/strataloanimus.jpeg" alt="A strataloanimus specimen." title="A strataloanimus specimen."/><img src="../problem-set-3/images/cirroanimus.jpg" alt="A cirroanimus specimen." title="A cirroanimus specimen."/> <img src="../problem-set-3/images/nimbuloanimus.jpeg" alt="A nimbuloanimus specimen." title="A nimbuloanimus specimen."/>
      <ul>
        <li>Cumuloanimus are characterized by their large, puffy exterior. Inside this, there is a thin shell of fine ice particles, which function similar to chitin in crustaceans and both oceanic and terrestrial athropods. Inside this shell, organs develop with a high density and are extremely compact. Many have multiple ocular organs and poor hearing.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Strataloanimus are characterized by a long, vertebral outside appearance. Lacking the ice particulate shell, these lengthy zhenitankh are similar to the Serpentes family, and to their similar-looking aquatic approximations, Mastacembiladae (spiny eels). Known for lacking outward locomotion organs and instead "slithering" through the air.</li>
