      <h1>Nephotaxonomy: Cloud Genera and Taxonomical Classification</h1>
        <h4>An exercise in worldbuilding</h4>
          <h5>Originally conceived by Aidan Bennett</h5>
      <p>Most species of zhenitankh are almost identical to their nonliving counterparts. Both are mainly composed of fine water vapour particles. However, obviously, living clouds come with the inclusion of several internal organs and body parts which perform various functions based on the species of cloud they are located in. For instance, a hand that grasps other clouds in a predatory could be a sort of membranous locomotion appendage in an algaevorous specimen. However, most clouds have at least the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A set of 6-45 bones arranged in a traditional spinal column, much like in dogs or other tetrapodal organisms.</li>
        <li>Some sort of locomotive bone structure or membrane, so that the zhenitankh can guide itself in the mind-boggling speed of the jetstreams.</li>
        <li>Organs at least somewhat analogous to those in humans, such as lungs (much larger due to lack of oxygen in their environment), a heart, and a brain.</li>
        <li>Sensory organs such as eyes and ears, or a structure that acts like a plate conducive to ultrasonic echolocation.</li>
