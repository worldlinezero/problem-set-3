# Problem Set 3½

Problem Set 3½ allows you to continue exploring your creating side. Having already designed and built your first website, we'll now be using CSS to make it look much nicer.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository to store your Problem Set 3½ code. After cloning my skeleton repository, you'll need to setup a remote to push your code to your repository instead of mine. Steps to accomplish this are outlined below.

### Setup

01. Login to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and create a new repository named `problem-set-3.5`.
02. In Git Bash, navigate to your `APCSP` folder.
```
cd ~/Desktop/APCSP
```
03. Clone my skeleton repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make a copy of my repository and store it locally.
```
git clone git@github.com:rwilson-ucvts/principles-pset-3.5-skeleton.git
```
04. The cloning process will create a folder named `principles-pset-3.5-skeleton`. Rename this folder to `problem-set-3.5`.
```
mv principles-pset-3.5-skeleton problem-set-3.5
```
05. Change directories to get into your `problem-set-3.5` folder.
```
cd problem-set-3.5
```
06. The cloning process will add a remote named `origin` that points at my skeleton repository. Rename `origin` to `upstream`.
```
git remote rename origin upstream
```
07. Add a new remote that points at the `problem-set-3.5` repository you created earlier. Make sure you replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual [GitHub](https://github.com/) username.
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/problem-set-3.5.git
```
08. Launch [Atom](https://atom.io/), select `File` and click `Add Project Folder...`.
09. Navigate to the `APCSP` folder on your `Desktop`, click the `problem-set-3.5` project folder, and click `Open`.

You should now see a folder named `problem-set-3.5` in the `Project` panel in [Atom](https://atom.io/).

10. Expand the `Project` folder. You should see a file named `README.md` (which is what you're reading right now!). That's all you get - no starter code this time! That's because you'll be copying over your existing files and folders from your `problem-set-3` repository.
11. To do that, add another remote that points at your previous `problem-set-3` repository. Again, make sure you replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual [GitHub](https://github.com/) username.
```
git remote add pset3 git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/problem-set-3.git
```
12. Now, pull down all of the files and folders in your `problem-set-3` directory into your newly created `problem-set-3.5` directory.
```
git pull pset3 master --allow-unrelated-histories
```
13. You'll need to resolve a conflict by manually merging the `README.md` files from `problem-set-3` and `problem-set-3.5`. You can do this directly in [Atom](https://atom.io/) by clicking the `Use me` button associated with the `README.md` file of the `problem-set-3.5` repository. Make sure you save it afterwards.
14. You can now remove the `pset3` remote. You won't need to use it again.
```
git remote remove pset3
```

## Requirements

Modify the website you created for Problem Set 3, and create a new and improved website for Problem Set 3½. You'll be adding CSS to make it look a whole lot cooler. You're free to exercise creative expression and design, but must meet the minimum specifications below.

More specifically, your website must include and incorporate the following features and elements.

* At least 1 externally linked CSS file, which contains the vast majority of your styles.
   - Your CSS file(s) should be in a folder named `styles`.
* At least 3 inline styles per page (for one-off styles that typically aren't replicated elsewhere).
* At least 3 different [type selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors).
* At least 3 different [class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors).
* At least 3 different [ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors).
* At least 3 different [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors).
* At least 1 [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors).
* At least 3 different [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#Combinators).
* At least 3 different [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).
* A `background-color` for each page.
   - If you wish, you may incorporate multiple `background-color`s on a single page.
* A `font`, `font-size`, `font-style`, `font-weight`, `color`, and `text-decoration` for at least 1 (though not necessarily the same) text element per page.
* A `:hover` effect for each link.
* Appropriate element spacing using `margin` and/or `padding` (this is understandbly subjective).
* A `border` around at least 1 image per page.
   - At least 1 of your `border`s must incorporate rounded corners.
* All `img` dimensions must be defined in the externally linked CSS page, and not as a tag attribute.

To avoid confusion, your directory structure must match the following. If something is followed with a `/`, it is a folder; otherwise, it is a file.

   index.html
   recipes.html
   ingredients.html
   suppliers.html
   README.md
   styles/
      yourfile.css
```

Of course, your filenames will be different than mine. They are alphabetized, so they will likely appear in a different order, too. The `meals/` subfolder inside of the `images/` folder is optional. You might find it useful to further categorize your pictures, but it is not required. The image files inside of the `images/` and `meals/` folders are examples. Yours, of course, will be named differently.

## Deadline

Your Canvas submission is due at or before 11:59pm on **Sunday, October 21, 2018**. Please make sure you verify how many grace days you have remaining for this marking period.
